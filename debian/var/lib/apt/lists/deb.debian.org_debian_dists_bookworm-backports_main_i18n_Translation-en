Description-en: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK - tool
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google’s product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.

 Approx is an HTTP-based proxy server for Debian-style package archives.
 It fetches files from remote repositories on demand,
 and caches them for local use.
 .
 Approx saves time and network bandwidth if you need to install or
 upgrade .deb packages for a number of machines on a local network.
 Each package is downloaded from a remote site only once,
 regardless of how many local clients install it.
 The approx cache typically requires a few gigabytes of disk space.
 .
 Approx also simplifies the administration of client machines:
 repository locations need only be changed in approx's configuration file,
 not in every client's /etc/apt/sources.list file.
 .
 Approx can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy,
 with no need to modify clients' /etc/apt/sources.list files,
 or as an alternative to apt-cacher.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

  * Move semantics are implemented, including move emulation
    for pre-C++11 compilers.
  * New advanced features (e.g. placement insertion,
    recursive containers) are present.
  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in
      replacements for standard associative containers but more
      memory friendly and with faster searches.
    * stable_vector: a std::list and std::vector hybrid container:
      vector-like random-access iterators and list-like iterator
      stability in insertions and erasures.
    * slist: the classic pre-standard singly linked list implementation
      offering constant-time size(). Note that C++11 forward_list has no size().

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

Description-en: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).
 .
 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

Description-en: cooperatively-scheduled micro-/userland-threads
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)
 scheduled cooperatively.  The API contains classes and functions to
 manage and synchronize fibers similarly to standard thread support
 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C

Description-md5: 798250c772fac56d605e432dcc6fe14f
Description-en: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description-md5: 183ec39aba3cb8efddeb8687a04e58e3
Description-en: C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers
 Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also
 provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.
 .
 Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural.
 Test names do not have to be valid identifiers, assertions look like
 normal C++ boolean expressions, and sections provide a nice and local
 way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.
 .
 If you've been using Catch2 v2, please see the migrate-v2-to-v3.md
 file in the package documentation. v3 brings a bunch of significant
 changes, the big one being that Catch2 is no longer a single-header
 library. Catch2 now behaves as a normal library, with multiple
 headers and separately compiled implementation.

Description-md5: 231da2850196f5814401fe70a32cc870
Description-en: ESO library for automated astronomical data-reduction
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks (known
 as "pipelines").
 .
 The CPL was developed to standardise the way instrument pipelines
 are built, to shorten their development cycle and to ease their
 maintenance. However, it may be more generally applied to any similar
 application, and the details of the CPL code have been engineered in
 a way to make the library portable and flexible, as well as
 minimising external dependencies.
 .
 The CPL provides a host of functionality, presented in a clear,
 generic and uniform manner. Among its many features, the CPL offers:
 .
  * many useful low-level data types (images, tables, matrices, strings,
    property lists, ...),
  * many fundamental statistic, arithmetic and conversion operations for
    these data types.
  * medium-level data access methods (e.g. a data abstraction layer for
    FITS files),
  * data table organisation and manipulation,
  * keyword/value handling and management,
  * a standardised application interface for pipeline recipes, and,
  * support for dynamic loading of recipe modules.
 .
 Despite the current bias towards instrument pipeline development, the
 library also provides a variety of general-purpose image- and
 signal-processing functions, making it an excellent framework for the
 creation of more generic data-handling packages.
 .
 This package contains the static library and the C header files.

Package: debootstrap
Description-md5: 883a8efb3ed16248b0d2091d9c0b60c9
Description-en: Bootstrap a basic Debian system
 debootstrap is used to create a Debian base system from scratch,
 without requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by
 downloading .deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them
 into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.

Package: dh-debputy
Description-md5: 0a43251d363265f0459e396fcab3fea3
Description-en: Manifest style Debian-based package builder (debhelper integration)
 Package builder that provides a declarative manifest for building Debian-based
 packages.
 .
 The debputy package builder aims to reduce cognitive load for the packager
 and provide better introspection to packagers, linters and the Debian
 janitor.
 .
 The debputy package also provides its own linting and editor support features
 via the debputy-lsp package that are aimed at as-you-type feedback.
 .
 This version integrates with the debhelper sequencer dh. Multiple integration
 modes are possible with dh. The most trivial integration mode is
 dh-sequence-zz-debputy-rrr, which is a mostly standard dh sequence with very
 few changes aimed entirely at removing the need for fakeroot when assembling
 the .deb.
 .
 For more information on all integration modes and what they do, please see
 https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debputy/-/blob/main/INTEGRATION-MODES.md

Package: debputy-lsp
Description-md5: c1d74e5c2718eca00cf60296dd0a0a48
Description-en: Editor support for Debian packaging files via LSP specification
 Dependency package that installs the minimal dependencies required for
 for the debputy language server, which can provide editor support via the
 Language Server Protocol (LSP). This package will also provide relevant
 dependencies for many of debputy assistance commands such as "debputy lint"
 and "debputy reformat".
 .
 Any editor with LSP support built with a compatible version of the LSP
 specification can interface with the debputy language server
 and use it to extend its feature set for Debian packaging files (debian/).
 .
 Concrete features depends on the editor in question, but common supported
 editor features include:
 .
  * As-you-type diagnostics with quick-fixes
  * Context aware completion suggestions
  * In-editor access to documentation (often called "hover docs")
 .
 The "Suggests" field may have a package dedicated to your favorite editor.
 If so, consider installing that instead as it will then also provide most of
 the relevant editor glue to enable debputy automatically. Otherwise, you still
 have to provide your own editor-side of the configuration to have it start
 debputy when you start editing debian packaging files.
 .
 For more information about the LSP specification, please see:
 https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/
 .
 For a list of tools / editors that supports some version of the LSP
 specification, please see:

 .
  - annotate-output: run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout,
    E for stderr) for every line of output.
  - archpath: Prints arch (tla/Bazaar 1.x) package names. Also supports
    calculating the package names for other branches. [tla]
  - bts: A command-line tool for accessing the Debian Bug Tracking System, both
    to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and
    SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser, libauthen-sasl-perl,
    libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl, bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given
    package. [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - dcmd: run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file
    with each of the files referenced therein. *
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *
  - debbisect: bisect snapshot.debian.org to find which change in the archive
    introduced a certain problem. [debvm, mmdebstrap, python3-debian]
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary. *
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to
    check that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debftbfs: list source packages which have FTBFS bugs filed against them
    and print them with the bug number and title.

    current package has just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb
    lives in the parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.
    The ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debootsnap: Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot
    containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used
    to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to reproduce a bug. The
    tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in a chroot with build
    dependencies in the same version as recorded in the buildinfo file.
    [apt-utils, equivs, mmdebstrap, python3-debian, python3-pycurl,
    python3-requests]

    the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - debrebuild: Given a buildinfo file, builds the referenced source package
    in an environment documented in the provided buildinfo file. The build
    can be performed by sbuild or other builders in a chroot environment created
    by debootsnap. The generated artifacts will be verified against the
    hashes from the buildinfo file.
    [sbuild | mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl, libdpkg-perl]
  - debrepro: A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will
    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on
    a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the
    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg, debian-keyring,
    ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]

    have any major policy violations. [lintian, gnupg]*
  - deb-check-file-conflicts: Check (using apt-file) if a
    Debian package installs files in the exact same path as any other package, and
    if there are Breaks/Replaces (or Conflicts) defined in debian/control to avoid
    the package installation failing on file conflicts.

 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users to set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.

Package: erlang-luerl
Description-md5: ba0442956c0172294ab501db8dfd5616
Description-en: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Package: erlang-p1-pkix
Description-md5: 17490bcd12287b68f22b6961bdae9b3c
Description-en: PKIX certificates management library for Erlang
 The idea of the library is to simplify certificates configuration in Erlang
 programs. Typically an Erlang program which needs certificates  (for HTTPS/
 MQTT/XMPP/etc) provides a bunch of options such as certfile,  chainfile,
 privkey, etc. The situation becomes even more complicated when a  server
 supports so called virtual domains because a program is typically  required to
 match a virtual domain with its certificate. If a user has plenty  of virtual
 domains it's quickly becoming a nightmare for them to configure all this.
 The complexity also leads to errors: a single configuration mistake and a
 program generates obscure log messages, unreadable Erlang tracebacks or,
 even worse, just silently ignores the errors.
 Fortunately, the large part of certificates configuration can be automated,
 reducing a user configuration to something as simple as:
 .
 certfiles:
   - /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/*.pem
 .
 The purpose of this library is to do this dirty job under the hood.

Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

 It can run as a command line program to speak text from a file or from stdin.
 .
   * Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.
   * Can produce speech output as a WAV file.
   * Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
     for another speech synthesis engine.
   * Potential for other languages. More than 80 languages are included.
   * Compact size.
   * Written in C.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

 Note: Ironwood is pre-alpha work-in-progress. There's no stable API,
 versioning, or expectation that any two commits will be compatible with
 each other. Also, it hasn't been audited by a security expert. While the
 author is unaware of any security vulnerabilities, it would be wise to

 This package implements bitsets, a mapping between non-negative integers
 and boolean values.  It should be more efficient than map[uint] bool.
 .
 It provides methods for setting, clearing, flipping, and testing
 individual integers.
 .
 But it also provides set intersection, union, difference, complement,
 and symmetric operations, as well as tests to check whether any, all,
 or no bits are set, and querying a bitset's current length and number
 of positive bits.
 .
 BitSets are expanded to the size of the largest set bit; the memory
 allocation is approximately Max bits, where Max is the largest set
 bit. BitSets are never shrunk. On creation, a hint can be given for the
 number of bits that will be used.
 .
 Many of the methods, including Set, Clear, and Flip, return a BitSet
 pointer, which allows for chaining.

Package: golang-github-bmatcuk-doublestar-dev
Description-md5: 8ff9ae0e45df4fa1490d9545b797d79b
Description-en: support for double star matches in golang's path.Match and filepath.Glob
 This package contains a Golang implementation of path pattern matching
 and globbing with support for "doublestar" (aka globstar: **) patterns.
 .
 doublestar patterns match files and directories recursively. For example,
 if you had the following directory structure:
 .
 grandparent `-- parent
     |-- child1 `-- child2
 .
 You could find the children with patterns such as: **/child*,
 grandparent/**/child?, **/parent/*, or even just ** by itself (which
 will return all files and directories recursively).
 .
 Bash's globstar is doublestar's inspiration and, as such, works similarly.
 Note that the doublestar must appear as a path component by itself. A
 pattern such as /path** is invalid and will be treated the same as
 /path*, but /path*/** should achieve the desired result. Additionally,
 /path/** will match all directories and files under the path directory,
 but /path/**/ will only match directories.

 gorilla/csrf is a HTTP middleware library that provides cross-site request
 forgery (CSRF) protection.  It includes:
 .
  * The csrf.Protect middleware/handler provides CSRF protection on routes
    attached to a router or a sub-router.
  * A csrf.Token function that provides the token to pass into your response,
    whether that be a HTML form or a JSON response body.
  * ... and a csrf.TemplateField helper that you can pass into your
    html/template templates to replace a {{ .csrfField }} template tag
    with a hidden input field.
 .
 gorilla/csrf is designed to work with any Go web framework, including:
 .
  * The Gorilla toolkit
  * Go's built-in net/http package
  * Goji - see the tailored fork https://github.com/goji/csrf
  * Gin
  * Echo
  * ... and any other router/framework that rallies around Go's http.Handler
    interface.

Description-en: collection of useful handlers for Go's net/http package
 Package handlers is a collection of handlers (aka "HTTP middleware") for use
 with Go's net/http package (or any framework supporting http.Handler),
 including:
 .
  • LoggingHandler for logging HTTP requests in the Apache Common Log Format
    (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#common).
  • CombinedLoggingHandler for logging HTTP requests in the Apache Combined Log
    Format (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#combined) commonly used
    by both Apache and nginx.
  • CompressHandler for gzipping responses.
  • ContentTypeHandler for validating requests against a list of accepted
    content types.
  • MethodHandler for matching HTTP methods against handlers in a
    map[string]http.Handler
  • ProxyHeaders for populating r.RemoteAddr and r.URL.Scheme based on the
    X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto and RFC7239 Forwarded headers
    when running a Go server behind a HTTP reverse proxy.
  • CanonicalHost for re-directing to the preferred host when handling multiple
    domains (i.e. multiple CNAME aliases).
 .
 Other handlers are documented on the Gorilla website
 (http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/handlers).

Package: golang-github-gorilla-mux-dev
Description-md5: d61faf184d480e712a34f9f9497bde59
Description-en: powerful URL router and dispatcher for golang
 Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share
    common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes.
    As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

Description-en: Extremely flexible golang deep comparison
 go-testdeep is historically a go rewrite and adaptation of wonderful
 Test::Deep perl.
 .
 In golang, comparing data structure is usually done using
 reflect.DeepEqual or using a  package that uses this function behind
 the scene.
 .
 This function works very well, but it is not flexible. Both compared
 structures must match exactly and when a difference is returned, it is
 up to the caller to display it. Not easy when comparing big data
 structures.
 .
 The purpose of go-testdeep, via the td package and its helpers, is to
 do its best to introduce this missing flexibility using "operators",
 when the expected value (or one of its component) cannot be matched
 exactly, mixed with some useful comparison functions.

 interface a user-space program in Linux uses to communicate with the kernel. It
 can be used to add and remove interfaces, set ip addresses and routes, and
 configure ipsec. Netlink communication requires elevated privileges, so in most
 cases this code needs to be run as root. Since low-level netlink messages are
 inscrutable at best, the library attempts to provide an API that is loosely
 modeled on the CLI provied by iproute2. Actions like ip link add will be
 accomplished via a similarly named function like AddLink(). This library began
 its life as a fork of the netlink functionality in docker/libcontainer but was
 heavily rewritten to improve testability, performance, and to add new
 functionality like ipsec xfrm handling.

 A Bloom filter is a representation of a set of n items, where the main
 requirement is to make membership queries; i.e., whether an item is a

 .
 A Bloom filter has two parameters: m, a maximum size (typically a
 reasonably large multiple of the cardinality of the set to represent)
 and k, the number of hashing functions on elements of the set. (The
 actual hashing functions are important, too, but this is not a
 parameter for this implementation). A Bloom filter is backed by a BitSet
 (https://github.com/willf/bitset); a key is represented in the filter
 by setting the bits at each value of the  hashing functions (modulo
 m). Set membership is done by testing whether the bits at each value of
 the hashing functions (again, modulo m) are set. If so, the item is in
 the set. If the item is actually in the set, a Bloom filter will never
 fail (the true positive rate is 1.0); but it is susceptible to false
 positives. The art is to choose k and m correctly.
 .
 In this implementation, the hashing functions used is murmurhash
 (github.com/spaolacci/murmur3), a non-cryptographic hashing function.

Description-en: experimental and deprecated packages
 This subrepository holds experimental and deprecated (in the "old" directory)
 packages.
 .
 The idea for this subrepository originated as the "pkg/exp" directory of the
 main repository, but its presence there made it unavailable to users of the
 binary downloads of the Go installation. The subrepository has therefore been
 created to make it possible to "go get" these packages.
 .
 Warning: Packages here are experimental and unreliable. Some may one day be
 promoted to the main repository or other subrepository, or they may be modified
 arbitrarily or even disappear altogether.
 .
 In short, code in this subrepository is not subject to the Go 1 compatibility
 promise. (No subrepo is, but the promise is even more likely to be violated by
 go.exp than the others.)

Package: golang-starlark-dev
Description-md5: 5a1aa295a0cd291bd40de04d4e0f7208
Description-en: Interpreter for the Starlark configuration language
 Starlark is a dialect of Python intended for use as a configuration language.
 Like Python, it is an untyped dynamic language with high-level data types,
 first-class functions with lexical scope, and garbage collection. Unlike
 CPython, independent Starlark threads execute in parallel, so Starlark
 workloads scale well on parallel machines. Starlark is a small and simple
 language with a familiar and highly readable syntax. You can use it as an
 expressive notation for structured data, defining functions to eliminate
 repetition, or you can use it to add scripting capabilities to an existing
 application.
 .
 A Starlark interpreter is typically embedded within a larger application, and
 the application may define additional domain-specific functions and data types
 beyond those provided by the core language

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

Description-en: Off-The-Record messaging plugin for Irssi
 This plugin adds Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging support to the Irssi IRC
 client. Although primarily designed for use with the BitlBee IRC2IM
 gateway, it works within any query window, provided that your
 conversation partner's IRC client supports OTR.
 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  * Encryption - no one else can read your instant messages.
  * Authentication - you are assured the correspondent is who you think
    it is.
  * Deniability - the messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

Package: jdupes
Description-md5: c39c2d10a5bfd8aedad8944d3ef07d4f
Description-en: identify and delete or link duplicate files
 jdupes is a program based in fdupes. The main goal of jdupes is identify
 and taking actions upon duplicate files. In comparison with fdupes, jdupes
 is heavily modified from and improved.
 .
 The biggest reason to use jdupes is raw speed. In testing on various data
 sets, jdupes is over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.
 .
 Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
 If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
 way is always chosen.
 .
 jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of such
 features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over which
 file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is not
 afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1 switch
 which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was found
 to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.
 .
 jdupes can convert duplicate files in hardlinks or relative softlinks. It
 is useful in several scenarios, as in Debian packaging, to create relative
 symlinks to lots of duplicate files (it will substitute rdfind + symlinks
 commands, used to same purpose, when solving lintian duplicate-files).
 .
 Packages build for Linux versions have support to btrfs filesystem.

 The two fundamental use-cases that are handled by the parser are
 extraction and transformation (the syntheses use-case, where HTML
 pages are created from scratch, is better handled by other tools
 closer to the source of data).
 .
 In general, to use the HTMLParser you will need to be able to write
 code in the Java programming language. Although some example programs
 are provided that may be useful as they stand, it's more than likely
 you will need (or want) to create your own programs or modify the
 ones provided to match your intended application.

 LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX. It makes the power and
 typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to
 word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept of general
 mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional quality
 documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
 possible to use LaTeX commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's
 power is lost.

 You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:
  * chktex: check for typographical errors
  * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
  * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
  * gnumeric: import spreadsheats

Description-en: free implementation of the OpenGL API -- GLX vendor library
 Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
 that of OpenGL.  To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
 syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the authors make no claim that Mesa
 is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.

  * A hierarchical structure (directory tree).
  * POSIX file attributes (permissions, last access and modification times).
  * Special files (block and character devices, pipes and sockets).
  * Symbolic links and hard links.
  * Access control based on IP address and/or password.
 .
 Distinctive features of MooseFS are:
 .
  * High availability.
  * Fault tolerance.
  * Strong integrity check.
  * Capacity is dynamically expandable by simply adding new computers/disks.
  * Deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time
    (a file system level "trash bin").

 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
 playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams
 (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered
 output, and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is
 on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control
 for music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to
 install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been
 reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and
 flexible.
 .
 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the
 same computer mpd runs on.  The separate client and server design
 allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes
 independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually
 plays music.

 .
 It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset boundary,
 useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for
 instance.  You can do this by making Munin run an arbitrary command when you
 need to be alert it, or make use of the intrinsic Nagios support.

Description-en: plugin for OBS Studio providing a dummy source to execute commands
 This plugin provides a dummy source to execute arbitrary commands when a scene
 is switched.
 .
 Current features:
 .
   Start a command at the following events:
     * Show (the source is shown in either preview or program).
     * Hide (the source is hidden so that no longer shown in neither preview
       nor program).
     * Activate (the source goes to the program).
     * Deactivate (the source goes from the program).
     * Show in preview (the source goes to the preview).
     * Hide from preview (the source goes from the preview).
 .
   Optionally, kill the created process at these conditions (this feature is
   not available for Windows as of now):
     * When hiding, kill the process created at shown.
     * When deactivating, kill the process created at activated.
     * When hiding from the preview, kill the process created at preview.
 .
 Possible usage:
   * Implementing custom tally lights.
   * Controlling PTZ cameras by switching the scene. Ii is possible to combine
     with CURL to send some commands.
   * Start and stop a daemon program required for the scene.
   * Trigger other operations through websocket at the event. A helper script
     is available for this (request-websocket.py).
   * Start or stop a streaming and recording.
   * Open a full screen video.
   * Open a calculator to teach about finances when switching a scene.
   * Other actions.
 .
 Caution: since this plugin executes arbitrary commands, users need to consider
 security concerns. For example, when combining with obs-websocket plugin, a
 remote user could change property through the websocket interface so that the
 arbitrary commands can be executed.

 applications, system boot-up (BIOS, bootloaders, kernels), installers and whole
 operating systems.
 .
 Tests (using Perl syntax) generally consist mostly of sequences of code like:
   assert_and_click 'some_icon';
   assert_screen 'some_prompt';
   send_key 'ret';
 which are run using the os-autoinst test engine, by a worker. The tags named in
 scripts can then be associated with 'needles' (elements of screenshots) via the
 webUI (either from past tests, or while controlling a live test). Other testing
 possibilities include: serial-connected headless systems, multi-host networked
 tests, and non-VM 'real' systems.

 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

 Features of this library:
  * No threads. See http://blog.louiz.org/slixmpp. All parts of the API relying
    on threads are removed.
  * No support for Python < 3.4. This allows one to remove a lot of workaround
    and other hacks.
  * No backward compatibility with old SleekXMPP version. For example things
    like “addHandler = add_handler” are removed.

 You should use this library only if you would prefer not to use threads in
 your application. If threads don’t really bother you, or if you need Python
 2 support, then you should use SleekXMPP instead.

 building, you can see the density and texture of the data rather than
 a simplification from dropping supposedly unimportant features or
 clustering or aggregating them.

 something that looks like "All Streets" rather than something that looks
 like an Interstate road atlas.
 .
 If you give it all the building footprints in Los Angeles and zoom out
 far enough that most individual buildings are no longer discernable,
 you should still be able to see the extent and variety of development
 in every neighborhood, not just the largest downtown buildings.
 .
 If you give it a collection of years of tweet locations, you should be
 able to see the shape and relative popularity of every point of interest
 and every significant travel corridor.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb

Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: libvkfft-dev
Description-md5: 314bc149ca3cc4d09a087c5acb35ce4f
Description-en: Vulkan/CUDA/HIP/OpenCL Fast Fourier Transform library
 VkFFT is an efficient GPU-accelerated multidimensional Fast Fourier
 Transform library for Vulkan/CUDA/HIP/OpenCL projects. VkFFT aims to
 provide the community with an open-source alternative to Nvidia's
 cuFFT library while achieving better performance. VkFFT is written in
 C language and supports Vulkan, CUDA, HIP and OpenCL as backends.
 .
  + 1D/2D/3D systems
 .
  + Forward and inverse directions of FFT
 .
  + Support for big FFT dimension sizes. Current limits: C2C or even
 C2R/R2C - (2^32, 2^32, 2^32). Odd C2R/R2C - (2^12, 2^32, 2^32). R2R -
 (2^12, 2^12, 2^12). Depends on the amount of shared memory on the
 device. (will be increased later).
 .
  + Radix-2/3/4/5/7/8/11/13 FFT. Sequences using radix 3, 5, 7, 11 and
 13 have comparable performance to that of powers of 2.
 .
  + Bluestein's FFT algorithm for all other sequences. Full coverage
 of C2C range, single upload (2^12, 2^12, 2^12) for
 R2C/C2R/R2R. Optimized to have as few memory transfers as possible by
 using zero padding and merged convolution support of VkFFT
 .
  + Single, double and half precision support. Double precision uses
 CPU-generated LUT tables. Half precision still does all computations
 in single and only uses half precision to store data.
 .
  + All transformations are performed in-place with no performance
 loss. Out-of-place transforms are supported by selecting different
 input/output buffers.
 .
  + No additional transposition uploads. Note: Data can be reshuffled
 after the Four Step FFT algorithm with an additional buffer (for big
 sequences). Doesn't matter for convolutions - they return to the
 input ordering (saves memory).
 .
  + Complex to complex (C2C), real to complex (R2C), complex to real
 (C2R) transformations and real to real (R2R) Discrete Cosine
 Transformations of types I, II, III and IV. R2R, R2C and C2R are
 optimized to run up to 2x times faster than C2C and take 2x less
 memory
 .
  + 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 convolutions with symmetric or nonsymmetric kernel
 (no register overutilization)
 .
  + Native zero padding to model open systems (up to 2x faster than
 simply padding input array with zeros). Can specify the range of
 sequences filled with zeros and the direction where zero padding is
 applied (read or write stage)
 .
  + WHDCN layout - data is stored in the following order (sorted by
 increase in strides): the width, the height, the depth, the
 coordinate (the number of feature maps), the batch number
 .
  + Multiple feature/batch convolutions - one input, multiple kernels
 .
  + Multiple input/output/temporary buffer split. Allows using data
 split between different memory allocations and mitigates 4GB single
 allocation limit.
 .
  + Works on Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. And Raspberry Pi 4 GPU.
 .
  + Works on Windows, Linux and macOS
 .
  + VkFFT supports Vulkan, CUDA, HIP and OpenCL as backend to cover
 wide range of APIs
 .
  + Header-only library with Vulkan interface, which allows appending
 VkFFT directly to user's command buffer. Kernels are compiled at
 run-time

Package: wasi-libc
Description-md5: 5c76134a8fd2c45d2a718c523fcce37f
Description-en: WASI libc implementation for WebAssembly
 This is a work in progress. It's usable for many purposes, though the APIs
 aren't stable yet. For example, this is used by the Rust compiler to build
 its standard library for the wasm32-wasi target.
 .
 First, it's a usable libc. It builds a "libc" which can be used by compilers,
 such as Clang 8.0, using the wasm32-wasi target. It's a work in progress, but
 it is already sufficient to run basic programs.
 .
 Second, it's a "reference" implementation, which means the interfaces defined
 here can be used by other tools and libraries, even if they don't use all the
 actual implementations here. For example, we don't expect everyone will want to
 use the exact malloc implementation provided here, but tools and libraries
 using an ABI-compatible malloc interface will be able to interoperate
 regardless of which actual implementation is used.
 .
 Third, it's an example showing the use of the WASI API. The libc functionality
 is implemented using calls to WASI functions.

Package: wsjtx
Description-md5: 33c670742043c463eb8dedc322001017
Description-en: Weak-signal amateur radio communications
 WSJT-X implements amateur radio communication protocols or "modes" called
 FST4, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one
 called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from
 the Moon. These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs
 under extreme weak-signal conditions.
 .
 JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding
 (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They
 use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC. JT4 and JT65 were
 designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands. JT9 is
 optimized for the MF, and HF bands. It is about 2 dB more sensitive than
 JT65 while using less than 10% of the bandwidth. Q65 offers submodes with a
 wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings.
 .
 FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and 15 s
 long, respectively. MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.
 These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard
 callsigns and some popular contests.
 .
 FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these
 bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with
 the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates
 of information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is
 for quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not
 require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of
 modes like EbNaut.
 .
 WSPR mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation
 paths with low-power transmissions. WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X,
 including programmable "band-hopping".
 .
 This package does not contain non-free components required for "superfox"
 operation. See README.Debian for more details.
